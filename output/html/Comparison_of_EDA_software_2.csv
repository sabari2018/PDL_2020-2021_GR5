FreePCB,Microsoft Windows,GPL,Yes," A Printed circuit board design program for Printed circuit board. FreePCB allows for up to 16 copper layers, both Printed circuit board and Printed circuit board, and export of designs in Printed circuit board. Boards can be partially or fully autorouted with the Printed circuit boardPrinted circuit board autorouter by using the FpcROUTE Printed circuit board DSN design file translator. "

Verilator,Posix,GPL,," Verilator is the fastest free Verilog HDL simulator. It compiles synthesizable Verilog into cycle accurate C++ or SystemC code following 2-state synthesis (zero delay) semantics. Benchmarks reported on its website suggest it is several times faster than commercial event driven simulators such as SystemC, NC-Verilog and VCS, while not quite as fast as commercial cycle accurate modeling tools such as Carbon ModelStudio and ARC VTOC.
